// the different between  define() and const are :
/*
1- You can use constants anywhere after theyâ€™ve been defined, whereas with define(), 
you need to call define() first before using the constant.

2- Constants cannot be redefined. If you try to use define() or const again
with the same name, it will just display a warning and nothing else. On the other hand,  
using const twice will produce an error.

3- the const defined at the compile time  , while define() is used at runtime .
